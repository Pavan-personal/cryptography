In blockchain transactions we have public & private key pairs.
    -> Public key is used to reading transactions.
    -> Private key is used for initiating and doing transactions.

    - base64 -> 6 bits encoding
    - hex -> 4 bits encoding
    - ascii -> 8 bits encoding

Hashing is irreversable & encryption is bidirectional
Encryption -> Symetric (single key) & Asymetric (2 keys)

We can derive public key from a private key but we can't do vice versa

Creating a public private key pairs
    -> Generate key pair
    -> Create a message
    -> convert message into unit8Array
    -> sign it with private key
    -> now verify it with public key from another end

Using a seed phrase we can derive as many key pairs we want

Mnemonics(words) --> Seed --> Key pairs

We'll have derivation path from m (master seed) to different wallets
